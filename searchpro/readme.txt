## How Does BerqWP Work?
Unlike traditional speed optimization plugins, BerqWP optimizes your website using our proprietary optimization software called the **Photon Engine**. Instead of handling resource-intensive tasks on your web server, which can slow it down, BerqWP processes optimizations externally. This is crucial because heavy tasks like **critical CSS generation, WebP conversion, and JavaScript optimization** can overwhelm ordinary servers when performed at scale.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* When a webpage is added to the **Photon Engine** queue, BerqWP fetches the page‚Äôs HTML.
* Various optimizations are applied, including HTML minification, image conversion, lazy loading, and JavaScript execution control.
* Once optimized, the Photon Engine stores the **fully optimized HTML** in your website as a form of cache.
* To handle traffic before optimization is complete, BerqWP creates an **instant cache**, a placeholder cache with minimal optimizations, ensuring fast page loads even before full optimization.

## ‚úÖ Advanced Cache for Faster Server Response Time
BerqWP utilizes the WordPress **advanced-cache.php** file to deliver cached pages as fast as possible. By bypassing unnecessary database queries and reducing the number of files loaded on each request, BerqWP significantly improves **server response time (TTFB ‚Äì Time to First Byte)**, ensuring that your pages load within milliseconds.

## ‚úÖ Core Web Vitals Optimizations
BerqWP is designed to help websites achieve high scores on **Google‚Äôs Core Web Vitals**, improving user experience and SEO rankings.

**Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Optimization** 

* **Image Preloading:** BerqWP detects the LCP element (usually an image or banner) and preloads it to ensure it loads as quickly as possible.
* **WebP Conversion:** All images are converted into **WebP format**, reducing file size by **70% ‚Äì 85%** while maintaining quality.
* **Efficient Lazy Loading:** Images and background images only load when users scroll, reducing initial load time.

**Interaction to Next Paint (INP) & JavaScript Optimization**

* **JavaScript Delay:** BerqWP delays JavaScript execution until user interaction (mouse move, click, scroll, or tap), improving initial page load speed.
* **Multiple Execution Modes:** Choose between different JavaScript execution modes tailored to your website‚Äôs needs.

**Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Fixes**

* **Image Dimension Attributes:** BerqWP ensures all images have width and height attributes, preventing unexpected layout shifts.
* **Font Optimization:** Fonts are loaded efficiently with font-display: swap to eliminate render-blocking issues.

## ‚úÖ Critical CSS for Instant Rendering
Loading external stylesheets can delay rendering, so BerqWP generates **Critical CSS** for each page separately.

* The Critical CSS contains only the styles needed for the visible portion of the page.
* The remaining CSS loads **asynchronously**, ensuring fast page rendering without affecting layout or design.


## ‚úÖ BerqWP CDN ‚Äì Global Performance Boost
BerqWP integrates with **Cloudflare CDN** to ensure static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript, web fonts) load from the nearest server to the visitor‚Äôs location. This results in:

* **Reduced latency** and improved website performance globally.
* Faster **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** for all users.

## ‚úÖ Font Optimization for CLS Stability
* BerqWP **extracts and preloads** fonts used in above-the-fold content, ensuring faster font rendering.
* Uses font-display: swap to **prevent text from disappearing while fonts load**, improving user experience.

## ‚úÖ Optimization Modes for Flexibility
BerqWP offers four optimization modes:

* **Basic** ‚Äì Minimal optimizations, ensuring stability.
* **Medium** ‚Äì A balance between performance and compatibility.
* **Blaze** ‚Äì A balance between performance and User Experience.
* **Aggressive** ‚Äì Best for high-speed results

For best results, we recommend using **Aggressive mode**, but switching to a different mode can help if compatibility issues arise.

_"I have tried multiple caching software programs, but none of them were so easy to set up, and the results are incomparable! I have reached out several times to the support. They always respond, sometimes you have to wait (decent time), sometimes within a day they respond and solve your issue instantly. Keep up the good work!"_

* **‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ [Working really great](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/working-really-great/)**
_"Just bought the pro plugin and started using it replacing the 10web io which was great but expensive for me, I was just a little worried whether this one would work ok without conflicting with my current plugins so i tested the free version first and it worked fine. Good customer support as well. I would recommend the pro plugin but try the free one first and then decide."_

* **‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ [A must have](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-must-have-532/)**
_"It‚Äôs been a while without writing a review from my side, but BerqWP deserves my 5 stars.It‚Äôs incredible easy to use, seriously, a newbie could make it work easily. It improves loading times dramatically, to the point that I don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs the magic behind it (I‚Äôm not joking). I always thought that a bit more speed could be achieved at my websites, but not this much. I wasn‚Äôt aware that the servers that I use for my sites were capable of this speeds, and I always thought that part of the issue was using medium servers instead of top notch ones.Thank you so much guys! Keep doing your magic, I‚Äôll spread the word about you as I really want you to succeed and last forever. Oh, and I really can‚Äôt believe how your plugin can exceed that much what other premium plugins achieve (I tried quite a few)."_
